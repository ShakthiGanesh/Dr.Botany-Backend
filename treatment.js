        disease: "Sigatoka",
        impact:
            "Black sigatoka is a leaf-spot disease of banana plants caused by the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Morelet). Also known as black leaf streak, it was discovered in 1963 and named for its similarities with yellow SigatokaPlants with leaves damaged by the disease may have up to 50% lower yield of fruit, and control can take up to 50 sprays a year.",
        detection:
            "Black Sigatoka is also known as black leaf streak. The pathogen Mycosphaerella fijiensis causes streaks that run parallel to the leaves.In the early stages of the infection of the plant, the lesions have a rusty brown appearance and appear to be faint, paint-like specks on the leaves. They become more visible on the undersides of the banana leaf as the lesions and leaves grow. The spots on the undersides of leaf are the fungus itself. The sign of the pathogen consists of the ascocarp which holds the ascospores used for dissemination to infect healthy new plants when the environment is conducive. ",
        cure:
            "Management mainly involves chemical control using fungicides like copper oxychloride, mancozeb, chlorothalonil or carbendazim at the prescribed dosage. Fungicide spraying on the foliage and pseudostem should be commenced with the initial appearance and repeated at two weeksâ€™ interval. Use of the different fungicides in rotation will reduce the risk of resistance development in the pathogen to the systemic chemicals.",

        disease: "Brown Spot",
        impact:
            "The fungus also survives on collateral hosts. The fungus can survive in the seed for more than 4 years. Infected seeds, volunteer rice, infected rice debris, and several weeds are the major sources of inoculums in the field. Infected seeds give rise to infected seedlings. The fungus can spread from plant to plant and in the field by airborne spores. The disease is common in nutrient-deficient soils and unflooded soil but rare on rice grown on fertile soils. Abnormal soils, which are deficient in nutrient elements, or soils in a much-reduced condition in which toxic substances accumulate favor the development of the disease.",
        detection:
            "The fungus attacks the crop from seedling in nursery to milk stage in main field. The disease appears first as minute brown dots, later becoming cylindrical or oval to circular. Spots measures 0.5 to 2.0mm in breadth - coalesce to form large patches. Then several spots coalesce and the leaf dries up.",
        cure:
            "Seed soak / seed treatment with Captan or Thiram at 2.0g /kg of seed. Spray Mancozeb (2.0g/lit) or Edifenphos (1ml/lit) - 2 to 3 times at 10 - 15 day intervals.Spray preferably during early hours or afternoon at flowering and post - flowering stages. Seed treatment with Agrosan or Ceresan 2.5 g/kg seed to ward off seedling blight stage; Spraying copper fungicides to control secondary spread; Grisepfulvin, nystatin, aureofungin, and similar antibiotics have been found effective in preventing primary seedling infection. Seed treatment with captan, thiram, chitosan, carbendazim, or mancozeb has been found to reduce seedling infection. Seed treatment with tricyclazole followed by spraying of mancozeb + tricyclazole at tillering and late booting stages gave good control of the disease. Application of edifenphos, chitosan, iprodione, or carbendazim in the field is also advisable.",

        detection:
            "The mining of the grubs will be clearly seen on the leaves. Scraping of the upper surface of the leaf blade leaving only the lower epidermis as white streaks parallel to the midrib. Tunneling of larvae through leaf tissue causes irregular translucent white patches that are parallel to the leaf veins. Damaged leaves wither off. Rice field appears burnt when severely infested.",
        cure:
            "Avoid over fertilizing the field. Close plant spacing results in greater leaf densities that can tolerate higher hispa numbers.Leaf tip containing blotch mines should be destroyed. Manual collection and killing of beetles â€“ hand nets.To prevent egg laying of the pests, the shoot tips can be cut. Clipping and burying shoots in the mud can reduce grub populations by 75 - 92%. Reduviid bug eats upon the adults. Spraying of methyl parathion 0.05% or Quinalphos 0.05%.",

            "Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. A leaf blast infection can kill seedlings or plants up to the tillering stage. At later growth stages, a severe leaf blast infection reduces leaf area for grain fill, reducing grain yield.",
        detection:
            "Above ground parts of the rice plant (leaves,  nodes and neck) are attacked by the fungus. Initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with brown border.Small specks originate on leaves - subsequently enlarge into spindle shaped spots (0.5  to 1.5 cm length and 0.3 to 0.5 cm width) with ashy center.Older lesions are elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders. Several spots coalesce to form big irregular patches. Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected area. Inter nodal infection also occurs at the base of the plant which causes white panicles similar to that induced by yellow stem borer or water deficit. Lesions on the neck are grayish brown and causes the girdling of the neck and the panicle to fall over",
        cure:
            "Carbendazim or Tricyclozole at 2 g/lit of water for 1 kg of seed. Soak the seeds in the solution for 2 h. Drain the solution, sprout the seeds and sow in the nursery bed. This wet seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up to 40 days from seedling disease such as blast and this method is better than dry seed treatment",
